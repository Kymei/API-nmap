# SCAAS project üïµüèº:

It is a python API developped with fastAPI that provides endpoints to:
***
* Create Scans
* Get the next scan to launch
* Get the list of scans done by a user
* Get the result of a scan
* Update the scan status
* Update the result of a scan
***

The scan is launched by another program that can run on a different machine (we can have multiple programs running in parallel).
That way, the API is always ready to accept new requests, and the alternatives programs executes the scans.
